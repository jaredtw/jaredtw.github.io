title: My experience with bloc
---

When I first started looking for coding schools/bootcamps, I obviously didn't know what to look for. I'm not even the one who found [bloc](www.bloc.io), it was my wife. I had looked at other places that I can't even remember the name of now. Bloc really looked good from the beginning, and it has remained good-looking ever since.

What was important for me, as a husband and a father, was job placement. Bloc is very promising in that respect. Even though I already have a job, being able to switch careers is very important to me because I am really unhappy with my current job environment. I think that's what inspired this whole thing, this idea that the environment could change. I wanted something progressive, and maybe that's not really an industry standpoint, but I believe it's influential.

The curriculum at bloc has been stellar, I really mean it. They[bloc] are focused on learning and retention, and it shows. I can see myself as a 20yr old doing this course and having differently nuanced struggles, with tailored support for whatever version of me is plugging along through the lessons. To begin with, bloc really eased into it, and it was exciting to gain so much with so little. What I mean is, the basic languages of html and css manage all the basic appearance of a webpage. Each progress step has been increasingly challenging, but it is all very good imo.

Now nearly halfway through, I am being taught and challenged, perhaps moreso the latter. I have started trying to teach the concepts I learn to my family, even though they don't really care lol. But teaching is a great way to learn, to reduce something to my own terms, to make something simple for reiteration. I'm sure someone famous said something quotable about it.
