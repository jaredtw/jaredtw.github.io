title: My journey into web development
---

I did not go to college, I started working out of high school. College just didn't seem to be presented as an option to me because of my poor motivation as a student. I attended a few community college courses and ultimately stopped going so I could work and make money. I have had many opportunities thus far that have enabled me to be employed my whole life and I'm grateful for that. But maybe I've come of age or matured or something and now I want a job that challenges me and is exciting and is something I'm interested in.

Enter web development. "Coding school" was the search term I entered one night at work. Maybe it was Mr. Robot the show that sparked my interest I don't know but all of a sudden I wanted to be able to code. I told my wife the next day and we both set off looking for programs we thought looked good and more importantly, promising for future employment in the industry. She's the one who found Bloc. It looked awesome to me: the site, the curriculum, the mission statement. It was gleaming. I couldn't wait.

I soon learned that my poor motivation as a student in grade school was from lack of challenge or "boredom." This Bloc curriculum has challenged me in a lot of ways, most of all, learning HOW to learn. Taking notes, studying, practicing; these were all things I had never done in school. The whole experience has been eye-opening in a way that I am very pleased to have discovered.

I am very excited about moving forward into web development and mastering these concepts I've been introduced to, and hopefully finding a new career because of it. Nothing would mean more to me.
